# Contributing to RandomStack
First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! :tada::+1:

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to RandomStack and its repositories, which are hosted in the [RandomStack Organization](https://github.com/randomstack) on GitHub. These are mostly guidelines, not rules. Use your best judgment, and feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.

## How Can I Contribute?
You can actively contribute to the RandomStack projects by **reporting bugs** or **suggesting enhancements** by creating issues on the main page of the project.
See [this](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-an-issue) guide for more information.

If you are feeling courageous you can always create a Pull Request to contribute to the RandomStack projects.
See [this](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork) guide for more information.

### Contributors
In your commit log message reference the related issue by typing the issue hashtag. When committing, always be sure to run an update before you commit.
If there is a conflict between the latest revision and your patch after the update, then it is your responsibility to track down the update that caused the conflict and determine the issue (and fix it).
If your code is committed and it introduces new functionality, please edit the wiki accordingly. We can easily roll back to previous revisions, so just do your best; point us to it and weâ€™ll see if it sticks!

### Code Quality
We generally abide by the standard Java Code Conventions. Besides that, just make an effort to write elegant code that:

- has comments and javadoc
- handles errors gracefully
- has consistent naming conventions.
- compiles (or runs if interpreted) without warnings.
