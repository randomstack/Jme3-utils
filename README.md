[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/randomstack/Jme3-utils.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/randomstack/Jme3-utils)

## How to build
This library uses gradle as build system, and comes with the gradle wrapper included. So no prior installation on your computer is required!
You can just use the `gradlew` or `gradlew.bat` executables in the root of the sources.

To run a full build, use:
```bash
$ ./gradlew build
```

To get an overview of all gradle tasks use:
```bash
$ ./gradlew tasks
```
